Due to Github's limitation on the size of file uploads, we are unable to fully upload the stellar-type catalog and training model to Github.

But you can obtain a complete stellar-type catalog through https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101125/,
and the weights of our trained SCNet and SCNet gri through https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_nZfjXI27ekGM1nZCOEqa95yVmASMZEX?usp=drive_link
